<figure class=" sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic "> The Clutha District Council is proposing to create a Vehicles on Beaches Bylaw to regulate the use of motor vehicles on beaches.The bylaw presents a mixed approach, with a total vehicle ban from dunes at all times and from the whole extension of eight beaches defined as ‘Safe Zones’. They were categorised as such due to cultural values, wildlife protection, landscape value, and concerns from the community over existing behaviour, particularly motorbikes. Other regulations such as speed limits and safe and respectful operation will apply to all beaches in the district.You can read the proposed bylaw here.NZPI made a submission fully supporting of the creation of the Vehicles on Beaches Bylaw. The beaches listed as ‘Safe Zones’ are used by fully protected species like the Yellow-eyed penguins/hoiho, Little penguins/kororā, New Zealand sea lion/rāpoka, New Zealand fur seals/kekeno and occasionally other crested penguin species.
