Head of the Herd and Forever Wild Society members are Seneca Park Zoo’s most devoted supporters, and by coming out in the rain last Wednesday night you proved it! It was so wonderful to be among so many friends who all share a lasting love of your Zoo. Thank you for hanging out with us, bringing guests, and enjoying a unique evening. For those of you who couldn’t make it, we appreciate you too! Next time you are visiting be sure to swing by the Member Entrance to say hello and add the 2025 Member Pin to your collection. Welcome again to our newest Forever Wild Society inductees, Jozef Kuzmkowski, John Littwitz, and Laurel Pace. Anyone interested in joining this illustrious group, our Chief Philanthropy Officer Chuck Levengood would love to talk to you about what your Zoo legacy could look like. You can reach him at clevengood@senecazoo.org or 585.336.7205. Thanks for leading the way – see you again next year. The post Head of the Herd 2025 appeared first on Seneca Park Zoo.
