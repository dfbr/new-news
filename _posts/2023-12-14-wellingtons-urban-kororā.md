We visited Wellington in October and were treated to some much needed sunshine! We had a great exploration of the rugged Wellington's Red Rocks Coastal Walkway at Te Kopahou Reserve, where kororā were once prevalent. Pest control gurus have been undertaking a huge amount of predator control and regular coastal clean ups, which is surely helping the few that remain around, however off-leash dogs pose a huge threat not only to kororā but the 100's of seals that visit. The birds also have to navigate a busy 4WD path, so we ask people to please keep an eye out when travelling around the reserve after dusk. We also had a good catch up with the awesome crew from Forest &amp; Bird - Places for Penguins and Wellington City Council to discuss development work and how best to protect kororā habitat. The PfP team are doing an amazing job watching out for their very urban penguins and it's great to see they have some input into the decision making!
