Posted by Jeana Chaffin, Events, with Tianyu Every night during WildLanterns, Woodland Park Zoo's PACCAR Auditorium lights up with awe-inspiring acrobatic performances at 5:30, 6:30, and 7:30 pm. Audiences leave buzzing with whispers of “How did they do that?” thanks to four extraordinary Tianyu performers, who blend centuries-old traditions with modern showmanship!Here’s a closer look at the artists and the incredible acts they bring to the stage.Rolling Cylinder Acrobatics Performed by Zhang Jianguo (张建国) Imagine balancing on a metal cylinder… then stacking another on top… and another. Rolling Cylinder Acrobatics is a breathtaking blend of strength, control, and nerve. Perched atop swaying metal tubes, the performer moves through spins, jumps, and even handstands, all while maintaining perfect balance.This act has deep roots in ancient Chinese court performances, dating as far back as the Han Dynasty. Over the centuries, traditional balancing skills evolved into today’s sleek, modern version, now recognized as one of the signature styles of Chinese acrobatics. Performer Zhang Jianguo (张建国) who began training at age 11 has dedicated more than seven years to mastering this craft. A graduate of the Ningjin County Acrobatic Art School, Zhang has earned top honors in multiple acrobatic competitions and performs at nearly 500 cultural events each year. Their calm presence atop an ever-growing tower of cylinders is one of WildLanterns’ most jaw-dropping moments.Foot Juggling Performed by Wei Meimei (魏美美) Foot Juggling is an astonishing display of dexterity and finesse that focuses on intricate footwork techniques. Lying on a specially designed platform, the performer uses only their feet to manipulate props with exceptional dexterity and precision. With origins stretching back over 2,000 years, foot-based performance skills have evolved alongside martial arts, opera, and dance. Today, Foot Juggling is one of the most recognizable elements of Chinese acrobatics. Our Foot Juggling artist, Wei Meimei (魏美美), is a graduate of Ningjin County Acrobatic Arts School with more than 22 years of professional acrobatic performance experience. They have performed around the world, including a five-year engagement in South Korea. Their award-winning artistry blends technical mastery with fluid, expressive movement that keeps audiences transfixed.Ball Juggling Performed by Gai Peng (盖澎) Ball Juggling is mesmerizing in its simplicity, but it requires extraordinary coordination and control. Performers create patterns that seem to float effortlessly through the air, shifting rhythm and tempo in ways that feel almost musical. The art of juggling in China dates back to the "throwing pellets" games of the pre-Qin era (before 221 BCE), with similar acts documented in Han Dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) brick carvings. Modern Chinese juggling fuses ancient traditions with Western techniques to create a uniquely dynamic art form. Gai Peng (盖澎), with over 12 years of professional experience, has earned multiple first-place awards in prestigious Shandong Acrobatics and Magic Competitions. Their performances in China and abroad — including cultural programs in Saudi Arabia — showcase a style that is both technically brilliant and joyfully expressive.Giant Hoop Dance Performed by Zhang Zerui (张泽锐) The Giant Hoop Dance merges dance, acrobatics, and visual storytelling into one hypnotic performance. Using a large metal hoop, the artist spins, rolls, and lifts the prop as if it’s an extension of their own body, a seamless blend of power, grace, and momentum. This act is a more recent innovation, emerging in the late 20th century as Chinese circus arts began incorporating modern dance and theatrical elements. Today, it stands as a stunning example of how traditional acrobatics continue to evolve. Performer Zhang Zerui (张泽锐) has over six years of experience in the acrobatics industry and a rapidly growing list of accolades, including awards at the Shandong Acrobatics and Magic Competition. Participating in nearly a hundred cultural events each year, they bring creativity, athleticism, and fresh energy to this captivating art form.Make sure you leave time during your WildLanterns visit to check out one of these awesome performances, located at PACCAR Auditorium (the large, cozy building at South Gate—just follow the glowing signs)!
