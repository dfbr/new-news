Seneca Park Zoo bids a fond and grateful farewell to John Adamski, Assistant Curator at the Seneca Park Zoo, whose exceptional leadership in herpetological conservation has left an indelible mark both locally and nationally. For more than a decade, John has been at the forefront of the Zoo’s conservation efforts for two critically important species: the Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake (EMR) and the Panamanian Golden Frog, a species now extinct in the wild. His work has extended far beyond our gates—shaping national policy, driving scientific research, and building collaborative bridges to help protect these imperiled animals. John’s commitment to Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake conservation has elevated both public awareness and scientific understanding of this threatened species. Through his leadership at the Zoo, he has tirelessly advocated for the preservation of critical habitat. For over ten years, John has participated in the AZA’s EMR SAFE program, traveling annually to Michigan to conduct vital field surveys. His efforts have contributed significantly to the growing body of knowledge that informs species recovery strategies and the expansion of breeding programs across the country. Equally impactful is John’s long-standing dedication to the survival of Panamanian Golden Frogs. Over the past 15 years, he has traveled frequently to Panama to work alongside staff and volunteers at the El Valle Amphibian Conservation Center, helping refine husbandry practices and advance the global strategy to sustain assurance colonies. His deep ties to this international conservation effort have strengthened the Zoo’s global reach while bringing this important story home to Rochester. John has also been a passionate ambassador for conservation within our community. From organizing Panamanian Golden Frog Day at the Zoo to bringing these iconic frogs to Hispanic Heritage Day at the Memorial Art Gallery each year, he has inspired countless guests to care more deeply about wildlife and the natural world. As John moves on to new endeavors, we celebrate his legacy of science, stewardship, and storytelling. His work has not only helped protect species at risk—it has ignited curiosity and compassion in the hearts of others. We are profoundly grateful for his years of service and the impact he has made at Seneca Park Zoo and beyond. Please join us in wishing John continued success and offering our heartfelt thanks for his remarkable contributions to conservation.
