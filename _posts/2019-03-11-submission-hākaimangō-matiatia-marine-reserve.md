<figure class=" sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic "> Image source: Friends of the Hauraki Gulf Inc Friends of the Hauraki Gulf Inc. recently submitted an application to the Department of Conservation (DOC) to create a new marine reserve on Waiheke Island. The proposed Marine Reserve is off the northwest coastline of the Island, covering 2,350 ha. It would span from Hākaimangō Point to Matiatia Point. NZPI is in full support of this proposal, which would see improved outcomes for kororā in the area. Waiheke island is a breeding stronghold for kororā/ little penguins in the inner Hauraki Gulf. Given kororā are at risk and declining, their population would benefit significantly from the increased biodiversity in these areas resulting from legal protections. The additional protections of the reserve would also increase the breeding success and survival of penguins in the area. Read our full submission to DOC below. Read our Submission
