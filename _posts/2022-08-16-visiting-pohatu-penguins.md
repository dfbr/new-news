title: Visiting Pohatu Penguins
---

Earlier in May, we had the great opportunity to visit a well established kororā conservation group in the Banks Peninsula, the Pohatu Penguins. Averil and Kevin Parthonnaud were so kind to organise a lunch with all the groups and scientists involved in the protection and advocacy of kororā in the region. <figure class=" sqs-block-image-figure intrinsic "> We learned about the efforts the local community undertook to carry out the Horomaka Survey in 2020 and 2021, the trapping work, rehabilitation efforts, the education programmes they run, and their future plans to research kororā at sea.It was awesome to meet the penguin monitors and get to demonstrate the updated version of the penguin monitoring app that synchronizes with the New Zealand Penguin Database.
