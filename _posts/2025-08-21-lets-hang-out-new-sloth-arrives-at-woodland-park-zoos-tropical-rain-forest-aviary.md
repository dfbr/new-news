Posted by Craig Newberry, CommunicationsPhotos: Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren/Woodland Park ZooHello, Fezzik! We're already in love with this Hoffmann's two-toed sloth.Some news to keep you on your toes! For the first time in five years, a new sloth is calling Woodland Park Zoo home. The sloth, named Fezzik after a character in The Princess Bride, is 10 years old and recently arrived from Milwaukee County Zoo.Fezzik is a Hoffmann’s two-toed sloth—Choloepus hoffmanni—they are solitary, tree-dwelling mammals named for their two long, curved claws on each of their front feet. These slow-moving nocturnal creatures spend the majority of their time hanging upside down in forest canopies where fruit, leaves and flowers are plentiful for munching.From every angle, Fezzik is perfection!Sloths, all of which are found in Central and South America, generally have very gentle dispositions and Fezzik is no exception!“We’re thrilled to bring a sloth species back to the zoo and Fezzik is busy leisurely exploring and getting comfortable in his new home,” said Shawn Pedersen, Animal Curator at Woodland Park Zoo. “Fezzik is sure to be a crowd pleaser with his calm and docile personality.”You can look for Fezzik hanging around in the zoo's Tropical Rain Forest aviary.You can find this thick-haired mammal chilling out in the zoo’s Tropical Rain Forest aviary along with dozens of exotic birds who also call the aviary home.
